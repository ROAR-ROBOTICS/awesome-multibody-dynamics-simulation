abstract = {â€” We present an interactive and stable multi-contact dynamic simulation algorithm for rigid bodies. Our approach is based on fast frictional dynamics (FFD) [5], which is designed for large sets of non-convex rigid bodies. We use a new friction model that performs velocity-level multi-contact simulation using impulse decomposition. Moreover, we accurately handle friction at each contact point using contact distribution and frictional impulse solvers that also take into account relative motion. We evaluate its performance on many complex multi-body benchmarks with thousands of contacts. In practice, our dynamics simulation algorithm takes a few milliseconds per time step and exhibits more stable behaviors.},

@article{Fetecau2003,
abstract = {Variational techniques are used to analyze the problem of rigid-body dynamics with impacts. The theory of smooth Lagrangian mechanics is extended to a nonsmooth context appropriate for collisions, and it is shown in what sense the system is symplectic and satisfies a Noether-style momentum conservation theorem. Discretizations of this nonsmooth mechanics are developed by using the methodology of variational discrete mechanics. This leads to variational integrators which are symplectic-momentum preserving and are consistent with the jump conditions given in the continuous theory. Specific examples of these methods are tested numerically, and the long-time stable energy behavior typical of variational methods is demonstrated.},

In the present paper we progressively describe the strategic components of a very general and robust inverse kinematics architecture. We then present an efficient recursive algorithm enforcing an arbitrary number of strict priorities to arbitrate the fulfillment of conflicting constraints. Due to its local nature, the moderate cost of the solution allows this architecture to run within an interactive environment. The algorithm is illustrated on the postural control of complex articulated figures.},

@article{Smith2012,
abstract = {Resolving simultaneous impacts is an open and significant problem in collision response modeling. Existing algorithms in this domain fail to fulfill at least one of five physical desiderata. To address this we present a simple generalized impact model motivated by both the successes and pitfalls of two popular approaches: pair-wise propagation and linear complementarity models. Our algorithm is the first to satisfy all identified desiderata, including simultaneously guaranteeing symmetry preservation, kinetic energy conservation, and allowing break-away. Furthermore, we address the associated problem of inelastic collapse, proposing a complementary generalized restitution model that eliminates this source of nontermination. We then consider the application of our models to the synchronous time-integration of large-scale assemblies of impacting rigid bodies. To enable such simulations we formulate a consistent frictional impact model that continues to satisfy the desiderata. Finally, we validate our proposed algorithm by correctly capturing the observed characteristics of physical experiments including the phenomenon of extended patterns in vertically oscillated granular materials. {\textcopyright} 2012 ACM 0730-0301/2012/08-ART106.},

abstract = {We present an efficient variational integrator for multibody systems. Variational integrators reformulate the equations of motion for multibody systems as discrete Euler-Lagrange (DEL) equations, transforming forward integration into a root-finding problem for the DEL equations. Variational integrators have been shown to be more robust and accurate in preserving fundamental properties of systems, such as momentum and energy, than many frequently used numerical integrators. However, state-of-the-art algorithms suffer from {\$}O(n{\^{}}3){\$} complexity, which is prohibitive for articulated multibody systems with a large number of degrees of freedom, {\$}n{\$}, in generalized coordinates. Our key contribution is to derive a recursive algorithm that evaluates DEL equations in {\$}O(n){\$}, which scales up well for complex multibody systems such as humanoid robots. Inspired by recursive Newton-Euler algorithm, our key insight is to formulate DEL equation individually for each body rather than for the entire system. Furthermore, we introduce a new quasi-Newton method that exploits the impulse-based dynamics algorithm, which is also {\$}O(n){\$}, to avoid the expensive Jacobian inversion in solving DEL equations. We demonstrate scalability and efficiency, as well as extensibility to holonomic constraints through several case studies.},
